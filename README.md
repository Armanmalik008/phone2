##  Overview
This project aims to predict mobile phone prices based on various features such as specifications, brand, and market trends. Using machine learning techniques, the model provides insights into price fluctuations and helps users make informed purchasing decisions.

## Dataset
The dataset contains multiple features related to mobile phones, such as:
- **Battery capacity**
- **Screen size & resolution**
- **RAM & storage**
- **Processor details**
- **Camera specifications**
- **Brand information**
- **Market price trends**

<h2> :book: Logistic Regression </h2>

<p> Logistic Regression is widely used in applications such as spam detection, medical diagnosis, and customer churn prediction. It works by applying a linear function to input features and passing the result through a sigmoid function to obtain probability values.

Basic parameters for Logistic Regression include the choice of regularization (L1 or L2), learning rate, and maximum iterations. Proper tuning of these parameters helps in achieving better model performance and avoiding overfitting.


## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy (for data manipulation)
- Scikit-learn (for machine learning models)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data visualization)
- Flask (for deployment, if applicable)
